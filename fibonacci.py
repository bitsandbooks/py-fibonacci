fibonacci.py: A simple Fibonacci sequencer.

In mathematical terms, the sequence F(n) of Fibonacci numbers is defined by 
adding the two previous numbers in the sequence, like so:
  F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2),

Let's start with 0 and 1 as our "seed" values and create a list of the first 
twelve Fibonacci numbers. Using pen and paper, we get the following sequence:
  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
